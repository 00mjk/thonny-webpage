Version 2.1.9
=============

Version 2.1.9 fixes couple of bugs including a nasty memory leak. Upgrade is recommended!

* FIXED #273: Memory leak in editor margin because of undo log
* FIXED #275: Updating line numbers is very inefficient
* FIXED: Pasted text occasionally was hidden below bottom edge of the editor
* FIXED: sys.exit() didn't really close the backend
