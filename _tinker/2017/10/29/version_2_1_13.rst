Version 2.1.13
==============
Version 2.1.13 introduces a workaround for an intermittent issue (#351). Because of this, features "Highlight local variables" and "Highlight matching names" are off by default. You can turn them on from *Tools => Options => Editor*.

See the `homepage <https://thonny.org>`_ for download links, and `wiki <https://bitbucket.org/plas/thonny/wiki/Home>`_ for installation instructions.
