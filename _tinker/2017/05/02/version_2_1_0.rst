Version 2.1
=============
I'm happy to announce the release of Thonny version 2.1!

Most significant addition is a simple pip GUI (Tools => Manage packages ...):

Other highlights:

* Thonny plug-in system now allows installing separately packaged plug-ins (Tools => Manage plug-ins...). NB! I encourage you to try out a **nice plug-in from Kauri Raba, which allows Thonny to use BBC micro:bit as its backend** -- see https://bitbucket.org/KauriRaba/thonny-microbit for more info.
* Built-in Python version has been upgraded to 3.6.1.
* The Shell finally accepts compound statements.
* Many bugs have been fixed.
* See `the changelog <https://bitbucket.org/plas/thonny/src/master/CHANGELOG.rst?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default>`_ for more details.

See `the homepage <https://thonny.org>`_ for download links.

Let me know of your experiences with the new version!

**UPDATE on 2017-05-04:** *Seems that in some cases at first run the cursor gets stuck somewhere, ie. no entry is possible neither in the shell nor in the editor. This was fixed in 2.1.1, but if you're reading this, the upgrade is not actually necessary -- just re-start Thonny and you're done (you won't meet this issue on next runs).*
