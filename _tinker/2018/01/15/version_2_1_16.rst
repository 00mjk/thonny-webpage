Version 2.1.16
==============
Versions 2.1.14 - 2.1.16 were created to support Thonny packaging on Linux and don't introduce anything new in the main code. 

2.1.16 was actually released in November, but today we are releasing Thonny+Python bundles for it.

Changes:

* Bundled Python has been upgraded to 3.6.4
* Bundled OpenSSL for Linux bundles been upgraded to 1.1.0g
* Windows installer has new signer (University of Tartu Institute of Computer Science). This means Windows Smart Screen filter may present warnings about its trustworthiness for some time.

NB! The certificate for older Windows installers (2.1.13 and older) will expire on 26th January.

See the `homepage <https://thonny.org>`_ for download links, and `wiki <https://bitbucket.org/plas/thonny/wiki/Home>`_ for installation instructions.
