Thonny and MicroPython
======================

Thonny 2.1 had a plug-in called `thonny-microbit <https://bitbucket.org/KauriRaba/thonny-microbit>`_, which added possibility to program BBC micro:bit.

Thonny 2.2 has plug-ins which add more general support for various MicroPython devices -- see https://bitbucket.org/plas/thonny-micropython for more info.

NB! You need at least `Thonny 2.2b3 <https://bitbucket.org/plas/thonny/downloads/>`_ to test it!
